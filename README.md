# TOP-ToDo

### Objective

Create a basic ToDo app that allows some level of organization and saves your tasks between sessions.

### FRIDGE

The concept is simple: you create to do's smiliar to how you would do with pins and paper on your fridge, or
a whiteboard.
There's only one big difference: this one can fit ALL you tasks!
